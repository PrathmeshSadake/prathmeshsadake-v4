        The American author and motivational speaker, Dale Carnegie, famously
        said, “Most of the important things in the world have been accomplished
        by people who have kept on trying when there seemed to be no hope at
        all.”
      </p>
      <p>
        These words ring especially true when I look back at my own life and all
        the things I’ve accomplished. If I had given up whenever things got
        tough, I would have never achieved anything. I’ve also come to realize
        that a lot of the success I’ve had in life is due to the things I wish I
        knew earlier. If I had known then what I know now, I would have been
        even more successful. In this article, I’ll be sharing with you 3 things
        I wish I knew earlier that would have made me happier and more
        successful.

      <h2>Happiness is a choice to remain in the present moment</h2>
      <p>
        The fewer desires you have, the greater your ability to accept the way
        things are right now.
      </p>

      <p>
        Every positive thought or judgment contains the seed of a corresponding
        negative thought. To say you’re happy, for example, means that you were
        unhappy at some point. To judge that one person is attractive, you
        invoke the idea of another’s ugliness. Similarly, a negative judgment
        about the bad weather today suggests the possibility of sunshine
        tomorrow.
      </p>
      <i>Choosing to remain present is a choice to be happy.</i>

      {/* <h2> Failure is inevitable</h2>
      <p>
        The nature of your successes is what really matters. Put differently,
        when you’re sitting on one Picasso, you don’t have to worry about the 99
        duds in your collection.
      </p> */}

      <h2> Networking is the key tool to growth</h2>
      <p>
        Keeping track of the people you meet is a great way to keep your
        networking on point. After you make such a list, you can reach out to
        each of the people before the week is over. Just remember, every time
        you reach out to someone, even with a simple “How are you?”, it
        reinforces your connection and you never know where that connection
        might take you.
      </p>

      <p>
        Engaged, meaningful connections aren’t about you, but about
        relationships. Connecting with people and forging productive networks
        require you to seek out shared interests, listen actively and set a
        foundation for trust.
      </p>

      {/* <h2>

        Money can give you freedom – unless you love it for its own sake.
      </h2>
      <p>
        Money fixes a lot of external problems. It removes obstacles that stop
        you from doing the things you really want to do.
      </p> */}

      <h2> Lean into short-term pain</h2>
      <p>
        If you’re faced with a problem with two relatively equal answers, choose
        the one that’s more painful in the short term. Why? Well, with most
        problems, one path to resolution will lead to short-term pain while the
        other leads to long-term pain. You obviously want the former, not the
        latter – but our brains tend to overvalue whatever offers us happiness
        most quickly. Leaning into the pain cancels out this subconscious
        tendency, and leads us to more durable happiness.
      </p>

      <h2>Final summary</h2>
      <p>
        Being happy is a skills. At heart, it's about making good decisions.
        Whether you’re talking about your time or money, you need to avoid bad
        investments. That means trusting your gut. If you can’t decide, say no.
        Remember that good investments are compounded – they yield outsized
        returns.
      </p>
      <p>
        Happiness, meanwhile, is a decision to be in the moment and turn the
        volume of your monkey mind down a notch. The best way of doing that?
        `Meditation`.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you’re faced with a problem with two relatively equal answers, choose
        the one that’s more painful in the short term. Think, for example, of
        working out. In the here and now, it can feel like a painful chore. In
        the long run, though, the returns on this investment in health and
        happiness are huge.

        In conclusion, these are a few things I wish I had known earlier. I hope
        that by sharing this knowledge, I can help others avoid making the same
        mistakes. If you want to stay up-to-date on my latest insights,
